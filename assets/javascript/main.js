/*
on page load, the topics in my array are rendered into buttons and displayed on the top of the screen 

upon clicking each button at the top, the website hits the Giphy api with the relevant search term, pulls 10 gifs, and displays them onscreen into the <div>

upon clicking each gif, it starts and stops playing

upon entering text into the form and clicking submit button, the page throws that into it's own button and renders it onscreen 

when you click the button you made, it pulls 10 gifs and displays them as well as you have the ability to click on them to start/stop
